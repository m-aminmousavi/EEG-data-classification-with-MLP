# EEG-data-classification-with-MLP

I have tired SVM, which is a well-known and robost algorithm. 
Finally, I have used MLP with TensorFlow using Keras.
The result of SVM is approximately 0.7 accuracy. 

Nevertheless, I have used MLP because of hereunder reasons:

- I have got near 0.76 accuracy

- in this scenario, the validation accuracy is better than train accuracy that demonstrates our model is training well.

- Thanks to Keras utilities, I can easily record the training log and visualize in each epochs for better understanding of the training process. Here you can see the result:
